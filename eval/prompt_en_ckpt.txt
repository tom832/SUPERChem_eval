### Role
You are an experienced university chemistry course design expert. Your core competency is to deconstruct complex chemistry problem-solving steps into their underlying knowledge points and the thinking skills necessary to execute each step.

### Task
Your task is to analyze a list of expert-defined "checkpoints" that represent the step-by-step solution to a chemistry problem. For **each individual checkpoint**, you must identify the specific **chemistry knowledge points** and **chemistry abilities** required to complete that step. You will be given the full context of the problem (question, options) to understand the purpose of each checkpoint.

### Input
#### Problem Context
**Question:**
{question}
**Options:**
{options}
---
#### Checkpoints to Analyze
Here is the ordered list of solution steps (checkpoints) you need to analyze one by one:
{checkpoints}

### Instructions
1.  **Understand Context**: First, read the "Problem Context" to understand the overall goal.
2.  **Iterate Through Checkpoints**: Go through the "Checkpoints to Analyze" list sequentially. For each checkpoint string:
3.  **Analyze Each Checkpoint Individually**:
    *   **Knowledge Point Extraction (Knowledge Tags)**: Identify the specific chemical terms or theories essential **for this specific step**. These should be concrete concepts. For example, for a checkpoint about analyzing NMR data, knowledge tags might be "Chemical Shift" or "Spin-Spin Coupling".
    *   **Ability Mapping (Ability Tags)**: Analyze the thinking skill used **in this specific step**. You **must** select the most appropriate and specific tag(s) from the "Chemistry Ability Framework" below. A single checkpoint usually corresponds to 1-2 core abilities. For instance, a checkpoint about using NMR data to find functional groups maps to `4.3 Spectroscopy & Structural Elucidation`. A checkpoint involving a Claisen condensation maps to `2.4 Product Structure Prediction`.
4.  **Strictly Adhere to the Framework**: You are forbidden from creating your own ability tags. You must select them precisely from the framework list, using the **English tags**.
5.  **Format the Output**: Consolidate your analysis for all checkpoints into a single JSON object as specified in the "Output" section.
